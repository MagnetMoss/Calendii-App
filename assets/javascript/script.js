// bootstrap a table
// fill bootstrap table with IDs and content
// link js with IDs= consoleLog EVERYTHING
// moment live time with past/present/future css code

// get the element that the info goes into
// decide on what it should look like
// and then update it...
// should this run in a loop and update the clock reguraly?
// create timeblocks with inputs and buttons
// loop and dynamically or I could hard code it.
// add events to the submit button to save what is in the
//     input to local storage
//  get the value out of local storage and populate
//     the input with the data
// check to see what the color of the input should be based on the time
//      moment?
// look at the css for classes later for this
// store data in localstrage as an object where the key is the hour of the day...
